Hello World and fellow Odinites!  
I am Assad. You can call me Buns or Pomato.

As the description of this repo says, I blanked out on doing the project that I forgot to create a new repo entirely.
So I decided to use this README file to showcase my actual commits here :D
I am totally not ugly crying here realizing this...T_T
