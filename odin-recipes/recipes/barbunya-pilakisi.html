    <h2>Barbunya Pilakisi in Turkish</h2>
    <p>Barbunya Pilakisi is a style of Turkish mezze, where vegetables and beans are mainly cooked with onions, garlic, tomato in olive oil, with a little addition of sugar, to balance the flavors.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350 gr/12 oz./2 cups dried borlotti beans (or cranberry beans), soaked in warm water overnight</li>
        <li>1 medium to large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, quartered and chopped in small cubes</li>
        <li>400 gr/ 1 can of good quality canned chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>Handful of flat leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>10 ml/ 2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>45ml/3 tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>16 fl. oz./2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 lemon, cut in wedges</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the dried borlotti (or cranberry) beans overnight or for at least 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Then drain the beans, rinse and transfer to a pot, filled with plenty of cold water.</li>
        <li>Bring the pot to the boil, partially cover the pot and simmer for about 30 – 35 minutes. Make sure the beans become tender, but not soft or mushy, they should still have a bite to them.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse the cooked beans under cold water and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in the pot and stir in the onions, sauté for 2 – 3 minutes, until they start to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots, combine well and sauté for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the canned tomatoes and sugar, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Combine well.</li>
        <li>Add the beans to the pot and give it a good mix. Then pour in the water, combine well.</li>
        <li>Bring the pot to the boil; then turn the heat to low, cover the pan partially.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 30 to 35 minutes, until the beans are cooked (but not mushy). Check the seasoning and add a little more salt or ground black pepper if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve Barbunya Pilaki at room temperature or cold as part of a mezze spread or appetizer, garnished with chopped parsley and wedges of lemon by the side to squeeze over. If you choose to serve next to main courses, I suggest serving Barbunya Pilaki warm.</li>
